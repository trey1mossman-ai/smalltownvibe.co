# 🎉 Image Setup Complete!

## ✅ What I've Done:

### 1. **Updated Hero Images Configuration**
- Changed `useWebP = true` in `hero-images.ts`
- All 3 hero images are now configured to use WebP format

### 2. **Created Business Image Directories**
```
/public/images/businesses/
├── dream-dinners/
├── goldie-links/
├── dapper-barbershop/
├── life-at-home/
├── pegasus-restaurant/
└── castle-rock-museum/
```

### 3. **Updated All Business Images**
- Dream Dinners: Meal prep packages (Image 9)
- Goldie Links: Permanent jewelry artist (Image 8)
- Dapper Barbershop: Barber at work (Image 6)
- Life At Home: Butterfly home decor (Image 4)
- Pegasus Restaurant: Interior with fireplace (Image 7)
- Castle Rock Museum: Watercolor artwork (Image 5)

## 📁 Where to Place Your Images:

### Hero Images (in `/public/images/hero/`)
1. **Image 1** → `castle-rock-aerial-downtown-view.webp`
2. **Image 2** → `castle-rock-downtown-landmark-view.webp`
3. **Image 3** → `castle-rock-downtown-street-view.webp`

### Business Images (in `/public/images/businesses/`)
- **Image 4** → `life-at-home/butterfly-home-decor.webp`
- **Image 5** → `castle-rock-museum/museum-watercolor-art.webp`
- **Image 6** → `dapper-barbershop/barber-at-work.webp`

- **Image 8** → `goldie-links/permanent-jewelry-artist.webp`
- **Image 9** → `dream-dinners/meal-prep-packages.webp`

## 🚀 Next Steps:

1. **Copy the WebP images** to their respective directories
2. **Test locally** to ensure all images load properly
3. **Run a build** to verify no broken image links
4. **Check PageSpeed Insights** for performance improvements
